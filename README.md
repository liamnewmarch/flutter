# Flutter

This is a playground for projects as I learn Flutter. Nothing here is intended to be polished or even functional.

Tutorials followed so far:

1. [hello_world](/hello_world/) – A ‘Hello, world’ button click counter adapted from Flutter’s [‘Test drive’](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive) getting started project.
2. [band_name](/band_name/) – A band name generator adapted from Flutter’s [‘Write your first app’](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) codelab.
